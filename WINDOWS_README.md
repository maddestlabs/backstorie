# Backstorie on Windows - Quick Start Guide

Welcome Windows users! Backstorie now has basic Windows support.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or later** (for ANSI escape sequence support)
- **Nim compiler** - [Download from nim-lang.org](https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html)
- **Windows Terminal** (strongly recommended) - [Get it from Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal)

## Installation

1. Install Nim if you haven't already
2. Clone this repository
3. You're ready to build!

## Building and Running

### Option 1: Using the Build Script (Easiest)

```batch
REM Build and run the default demo
build-windows.bat
backstorie.exe

REM Build and run an example
build-windows.bat examples\windows_test
backstorie.exe

REM Build and run the boxes example
build-windows.bat examples\boxes
backstorie.exe
```

### Option 2: Direct Compilation

```batch
REM Compile with Nim directly
nim c -d:release -d:userFile=examples\windows_test backstorie.nim

REM Run it
backstorie.exe
```

## First Steps

Try the minimal Windows test to verify everything works:

```batch
build-windows.bat examples\windows_test
backstorie.exe
```

You should see:
- A bordered screen with colored text
- Terminal size information
- FPS counter updating
- Color test showing multiple colors

Press `Q` or `ESC` to quit.

## Running Examples

All examples should work on Windows. Try them out:

```batch
REM Simple welcome screen (default)
build-windows.bat index
backstorie.exe

REM Animated boxes
build-windows.bat examples\boxes
backstorie.exe

REM Core events demonstration
build-windows.bat examples\core_events
backstorie.exe
```

## Troubleshooting

### Colors Don't Show Properly

**Solution:** Use Windows Terminal instead of legacy CMD.

```batch
REM Launch in Windows Terminal
wt backstorie.exe
```

### "Nim not found" Error

**Solution:** Make sure Nim is installed and in your PATH.

1. Download Nim from https://nim-lang.org/install_windows.html
2. Install using the installer (it will set up PATH)
3. Restart your terminal
4. Test with: `nim --version`

### Input Doesn't Work / Laggy

**Known Issue:** The current Windows input implementation is minimal. This will be improved in future updates. For now:
- Input should work but may have some latency
- Q and ESC keys should work for quitting
- More sophisticated input will be added later

### Screen Flickering

**Solution:** This might happen in some terminals. Try:
1. Use Windows Terminal (best results)
2. Make sure your terminal size doesn't change during runtime
3. Ensure no other programs are writing to the console

## What's Supported (Current Status)

✅ **Working:**
- Basic rendering and colors
- Terminal size detection
- Screen clearing and cursor control
- Basic keyboard input (letters, numbers, special keys)
- FPS control and timing
- Layer system
- All drawing functions

⚠️ **Limited:**
- Mouse input (experimental)
- Advanced keyboard events
- Input may have slight latency
- Resize events (polled, not event-based)

🔧 **Planned:**
- Improved input handling using ReadConsoleInput
- Better mouse support
- Full keyboard protocol support
- Signal handling (Ctrl+C cleanup)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always use Windows Terminal** - It has the best ANSI support and performance
2. **Run in fullscreen** - Gives you more space and better experience
3. **Use PowerShell or CMD from Windows Terminal** - Both work well
4. **Keep terminal size stable** - Resizing during runtime might cause visual glitches

## Creating Your Own Programs

Create a new `.nim` file with your code:

```nim
# my_app.nim

onInit = proc(state: AppState) =
  # Initialize your app
  discard

onUpdate = proc(state: AppState, dt: float) =
  # Update logic (runs every frame)
  discard

onRender = proc(state: AppState) =
  # Clear and draw
  state.currentBuffer.clear()
  
  let style = defaultStyle()
  state.currentBuffer.writeText(5, 5, "Hello from Windows!", style)

onInput = proc(state: AppState, event: InputEvent): bool =
  # Handle input
  if event.kind == KeyEvent and event.keyAction == Press:
    if event.keyCode == ord('q'):
      state.running = false
      return true
  return false

onShutdown = proc(state: AppState) =
  discard
```

Build and run:

```batch
build-windows.bat my_app
backstorie.exe
```

## Performance Notes

Windows Terminal should give you smooth 60 FPS for most applications. If you experience slowdowns:

1. Make sure you're using Windows Terminal (not legacy CMD)
2. Reduce the number of screen updates if you have complex rendering
3. Use layers efficiently to avoid redrawing everything
4. Check your FPS with the built-in counter

## What's Next?

The Windows implementation is functional but basic. Future improvements will focus on:

- Better input handling with full keyboard support
- Native mouse event handling
- Performance optimizations
- Better integration with Windows Console API

For now, enjoy building terminal applications on Windows with Backstorie! 🎉
